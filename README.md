# Hide Settlers Armor

Giving armor to your settlers is a good thing, it helps them survive longer through the raid. But... it's not good if you can't identify them anymore! No worries, this mod is here for the rescue!

## Multiplayer
This mod is only needed on the client side.

## Important Notes:
- Have fun playing the game :)
