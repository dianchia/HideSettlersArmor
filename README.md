# Hide Settlers Armor

Giving armor to your settlers is a good thing, it helps them survive longer through the raid.
But... it's not good if you can't identify them anymore!
No worries, this mod is here for the rescue!

## Multiplayer
This mod is only needed on the client side.

## Important Notes:
- Have fun playing the game :)

## Update notes:
- v0.1.1 - Only armor in armor slot will be hidden. Armor in cosmetic slot will be shown.
